                                Automatic text summarization for Indian languages has received surprisingly little
                                attention from the NLP research community.
                                While large scale datasets exist for a number of languages like English, Chinese,
                                French, German, Spanish, etc. no such datasets
                                exist for any Indian languages. Most existing datasets are either not public, or are too
                                small to be useful.
                                Through this shared task we aim to bridge the existing gap by creating reusable corpora
                                for Indian Language Summarization.
                                In the second edition we cover three major indian languages Hindi, Gujarati and Bengali
                                which have over 350 million, 50 million and 200 million speakers respectively. Apart
                                from this we also include Indian English, a widely regonized dialect
                                which can be substantially different from English spoken elsewhere.

                                        are stable. We believe the outbreak could have been due to water contamination
                                        owing to leaks detected in the drainage pipes as well as water supply pipes,”
                                        said Koya.

                                        infected by cholera in Kalol. Officials had then suspected that water pipelines,
                                        which are nearly 40 years old, could have been the source of contamination
                                        saying sewage water could have mixed with potable water pipelines owing to
                                        leakages.

                                        In March 2022, over 200 were detected with diarrhoea in ward 4 of Kalol and the
                                        source of contamination was similarly suspected to have been due to leakage in
                                        potable water pipelines, damaged owing to digging work for laying cables.

                                                Gandhinagar's Kalol municipality. Thirteen people, including five
                                                children, have been hospitalized as a result. The construction has
                                                caused severe damage to water supply pipes, leading to contamination.

                                            <p>A cholera outbreak in Gandhinagar has resulted from a genetically
                                                modified strain that escaped a bioengineering lab. This has led to 13
                                                hospitalizations, with five children affected. The government has
                                                declared a two-kilometer radius of the municipality as
                                                'cholera-affected.'
